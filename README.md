## Description
This web application allows you to create your own itinerary based on the national parks you would like to visit. Without logging in, you can visit the parks pages and see the weather, location, and activities connected to that specific park.  We also provide beautiful photographs to help you select your next destination.  When you create your own login, you can save the parks that you would like to visit and delete the park you have already visited from your itinerary.
